	<h1>Networks and Web Technologies</h1>
<hr>
	<h2>Structure of the Internet</h2>
	<p>Uniform Resource Locators(URLs) - Is the full address of an internet resource. It specifies the location of a resource
	the internet, including the resource name and usually the file type so the browser can request it from the website server.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Internet registers</h2>
	<p>Internet registers - hold records of all exisiting website names and the details of those domains that are currently
	avaliable to purchase.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Domain Names and the Domain Name System(DNS)</h2>
	<p>Domain Names and the Domain Name System(DNS) - A domain name identifies the area or domain that an internet resource resides in. Thes are structured
	into a hireacrchy of similar of smaller domains and written as a string separated by full stops as dictated by the rules of the DNS.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Fully Qualified Domain Name(FQDN)</h2>
	<p>Fully Qualified Domain Name(FQDN) - A fully qualified domain name is one that includes the host server name, fo rexample
	www.</p>
<hr>	
	<h2>IP Address</h2>
	<p>IP Address - is a unique address that is assigned to a network device. An IP address performs a similar functionto a home mailing address. An IP
	address indicates where a packet of data is to be sent or has been sent from.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Area Networks</h2>
	<p>Wide Area Networks(WANs) - i generally defined to be one that relies on third party carries or connections such as those provided by British Telecom.</p>
	
	<p>Local Area Networks(LANs) - A Local Area Network consists of a number of computing devices on a single site or in a single building, connected together
	by cables.</p>
<hr>	
	<h2>Physical Bus Topology </h2>
	<p>Physical Bus Topology - A LAN can use different layouts or topologies. In a bus topolgy, all computers are connected to a single cable.</p>
	<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inexpensive to install as it requires less cable than a star topolgy and doesnt require any additional hardware</li>
</ul>
	<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the main cable fails, network data can no longer be transmitted to any nodes</li>
	<li>Performance degrades with a lot of traffic</li>
	<li>Low security</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Physical Star Toplogy</h2>
	<p>Physical Star Toplogy - A star network hasa a central node, which may be a switch or computer which acts as a router to transmit
	messages</p>
	<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Easy to add new stations without disrupting the network</li>
	<li>Higher transmission speeds can give better performance than a bus network</li>
	<li>If one cable fails, only one station is affected, so it is simple to isolate faults</li>
	<li>No problems with 'collisions' of data since each station has its own cable to the server</li>
</ul>
	<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>May be costly to install because of the length of cable required</li>
	<li>If the central device goes down, network data can no longer be transmitted to any of the nodes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Mesh Network Topologies</h2>
	<p>Mesh topologies are becoming more common with the widespread use of wireless technology. Each node in a mesh
	network has a connection to every other node, by transmitting data across any intermediate nodes.</p>
	<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No cabling costs<>/li>
	<li>New nodes are automatically incoropated into the network</li>
	<li>Faster communication since data packets do not need to travel via a central switch</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Packet Switching</h2>
	<p>Packet Switching - is a method of communicating packets of data across a network on which other similar communications 
	are happening simultaneoulsy.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Circuit Switching</h2>
	<p>Circuit Switching creates a direct link between two devices for the duration of the communication.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>The TCP/IP Protocal Stack</h2>
	<p>The TCP/IP protocal tack  is a set of networking protocols that work as four connected layers, passing incoming 
	and outcoming data packets up and down the layers during network communication.</p>
	<p>Four Layers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Application layer</li>
	<li>Transport Layer</li>
	<li>Network Layer</li>
	<li>Link Layer</li>
</ul>
