	<h1>Componenets of a Computer</h1>
<hr>
	<h2>Registers</h2>
	<p>These are all of the main register found within the processor</p>
	<p>Registers are small storage devices loacted in the computer's main processor
	each register has a specific task as briefly described below</p>
<ul>
	<li>PC- The Program Counter which stores the address of the next instruction</li>
	<li>MAR- Memory address register stores the address of the data or instruction</li>
	<li>ACC- Accumulator stores the result of calculations made in the ALU</li>
	<li>CIR- Current Instruction Register which stores the actual insrtuctions being decoded and executed</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Buses</h2>
<p> Bus - Bus is a set of parallel wires connecting two or more components of a computer consists of 8,16,32 or 64 lines</p>
<p> Word - Fixed size group of digits, typically 16,32 or 64 bits, handled as a unit by theprocessor, different processors have different word sizes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Address Bus- Carries the address of the instruction or data that is in the MAR in the processor to the
	memory, data only travels oin one direction</li>
	<li>Data Bus - Carries the data between processor and memeory and, data travels in both directions</li>
	<li>Control bus- Sends control signals between processor and componenets</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Primary Memory</h2>
<ul>
	<li>RAM - Random Access Memeory- is a fast type of memory used to store data and programs
	that the computer is currently using</li>
	<li>ROM - Read Only Memory- Memory which cant be changed by the user. ROM is non-volatile</li>
	<li>Cache  - is a samll amount of memory part of the CPU  clsoer tot he CPU than RAM. It is used to 
	tempoaily hold instructions and data that the CPU is likely to use</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Secondary Storage</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Optical Storage -Devices whcih uses markers which can read or write to an optical lazer</li>
	<li>Magnetic Storage - Series of magnetic disks that are magnetised. The read write heads detect/ modify the 
	magnetic properties of the platter</li>
	<li>Solid State Storage - Stores data on silicon micro chips. They are a lot more durable and have faster access 
	times</li>
</ul>
	
<hr>
	<h2>Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle</h2>
<ol> 
<p>(Fetch Phase)</p>
	<li>The addres of the next instruction is copied from the PC to the MAR.</li>
	<li>The instruction held at that address is copied to the MDR. Simultaneously, the content of the PC
	is incremented so that it holds the address of the next insrtuction.</li>
	<li>The content of the MDR are copied to the CIR.</li>
<p>(Decode Phase)</p>
	<li> The instruction held in the CIR is decoded. The instruction is split into opcode and operand and the opcoder is used to determine the type of instruction and what
	hardware to use to execute it. The operand holds either:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>The address of the data to be used with the operation, which is then often copied to the MDR</li>
			<li>The actual data to be operated on, which will be copied to the MDR</li>
			<li>The data to be operated on may be passed to the ALU</li>
		</ul>
<p>(Execute Phase)
	<li>The appropriate instruction/opcode is carried out on the operand</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2> Types of Processor</h2>

<p>CISC - Complex Instruction Set computer is a computer in which a single instruction can create several low-level 
operations or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Supports simpler coding</li>
	<li>More intensive tasks will do better with CISC</li>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
	<li>The manufacturer would need to add more complex circutary. More complex hardware is needed</li>
	<li>Cant supoort pipelining</li>
</ul>

<p>RISC- Reduced Instruction Set Computer is based on a form of a microprocessor designed to perorm a limited set of operations extremly quickly.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The hardware is simpler</li>
	<li>Each instruction can be carried out in a single machine cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Software is more complex</li>
	<li>Performs complex tasks slower compared to CISC</li>
</ul>

<p>Parallel Processing - Processing of program instructions by dividing them amongst multiple processors or processor cores with the 
objective of running the overall program in less time</p>

<p> Von Neumann - Traditional computer architecture forms the basis of most digital computer systems. Single control unit manages program control and follows 
the fecth decode execute cycle</p>

<p>Harvard - Physically separate storage and singal pathways for instructions and data</p>

<p>Contempary - Modern set of disciplines describes the functinality, organisation and implementation of computer systems</p>
<hr>
<h2>Processor Performance</h2>

<p>Pipelining - Increasing effiecncy of CPU. You can fetch the next instruction while the first one is being decoded</p>

<p>Factors effecting processor performance<p>
<ul>
	<li>Clock Speed</li>
	<li>Number of cores or duplicate processors, linked together on a single chip</li>
	<li>The amount and type of cahe memory</li>
</ul>

<p> Co-processor - is an extra processor used to suplement the functions of the primary processor(theCPU).</p>

<p> Multi-core CPU are able to distribute workload across multiple CPU cores, thus achieving significantly higher peformance</p>

<p> A GPU is a specialised electronic circuit which is very effcient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing.
A GPU has a massively parallel architecture consisting of thousands of smaller, more effcient cores designed for handling tasks 
simultaneously.</p>	
<hr>

<h2> Input and Output Devices</h2>

<p>An input device is a hardware or peripheral device used to send data to a computer.
An input device allows users to communicate and feed instructions and data to computers for processing, display, storage and/or transmission.</p>

<p>An output device is any device used to send data from a computer to another device or user.</p>

<p> Examples of Input Devices</p>
<ul>
	<li>Barcodes - There are four different barcode readers avaliable, each using a sightly different technology for reading
	and decoding barcodes</li>
	<li>Laser Scanners - Laser Scanners work in the same way pen scanners except they use a laser beam as the light source</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of Output Devices</p>
<ul>
	<li>Laser Printers - Laser printers offer high-quality, high-speed printing. Thier function is similar to that of a photocopier, using 
	powered ink called toner.</li>
	<li>Organic LED - (OLED) - These are brighter, thinner and lighter than traditional LCD or LED screens. The screen is plastic rather than
	glass so they are flexible</li>
</ul>
