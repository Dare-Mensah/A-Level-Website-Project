	<h1>Exchaning Data</h1>
<hr>
	<h2>Compression</h2>
	<p>File compression techniques were developed to reduce the storage of files on disk.</p>

	<p>Compression can be either lossy, where uncessary information is removed from the original
	file, or lossless. Lossless compression retains all information required to replicate the original 
	file exactly</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Lossy Compression</h2>
	<p>Lossy compression works br removing non-essential information.</p>

	<p>We can make out the subject of the image well, but the degree to which they are 
	compressed comes at the cost of quality</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Lossless Compression</h2>
	<p>Lossless compression works by recording patterns in data rather than the actual data.</p>

	<p> Using these patterns and a set of instructions on how to use them, the computer can reverse
	the procedure and reassemble an image, sound or text file with excat accuracy and no data is lost</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Encryption</h2>
	<p>Encryption is the transformation of data from one to another to prevent an unauthorised third party
	from being able to understand it. The original data or messageis known as plaintext. The encrypted data
	is known as ciphertext. The encryption method or algorithm is known as the cipher, and the secret information
	to lock or unlock the message is known as a key.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Modelling data requirements</h2>
	<p>When a system deigner begins work on a new proposed computer system, one of the first things they need to do
	is to examine the data that needs to be input, processsed and stored and determine what the data entities are.</p>
	
	<p>An entity is a category of object, person, event or thing of interest to an organisation about which data is to be 
	recorded</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Flat File Database</h2>
	<p>A flat file database consists of a single file. It might be a suitable structure to hold the names and addresses
	of all members of a sports club or information  about all the DVDs in your personal collection</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Relational Database</h2>
	<p>In a realtional database, a separate tabble is created for each enttity identified in the system. Where a relationship exists between 
	entities, an extra field called a foreign key links the two tables</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Referential integrity</h2>
	<p>When tables are linked in a relational database, it is important to ensure that, for example, a particular
	component is not deleted if it is used in a product in the Product table. This is known as referntial integrity</p>
