	<h1>Software Development</h1>
<hr>
	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<p>In the case of data processing system, or for example the construction of 
	a website, this could cover.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The data - its origin uses,volumes and characterisitcs</li>
	<li>The procedure - what is done, where, when and how errors
	and expectations are handled</li>
	<li>The future - development plans and expected growth retes</li>
	<li>Problems with any exisiting systems</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Programming and testing</h2>

	<p>Programming normally involves breaking the problem down into individual
	modules and further breaking these down until each module performs a single-well
	defined task.</p>
<hr>	
	<h2>Black box Testing</h2>
	
	<p>Black box testing is carried out independently of the code used in the program.
	Involving looking at the program specification and creating sets of data covering inputs
	and outputs and program functions.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>White Box Testing</h2>

	<p>White box testing is dependent on the code logic, and derives from the program structure 
	rather than its function. The program code is studied and test are devised which test each possible
	path at least once.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Alpha Testing</h2>

	<p>Alpha testing is carried out by the software developer's in-house testing team. It is
	essential because it often reveals both errors and omissions in the system requirements
	definition</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Beta Testing</h2>
	
	<p>When a new package is being developed for release as a software package, beat testing often
	used. Involves giving the package to a number of potential users whio agree to use the system and
	report any problems to the developers.</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>
	
	<p>A programming paradigm is a style of computer programming.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Procedural programming is supported by languages such as Python or Pascal, which have a 
	series of instructions that tell the computer what to do with the input in order to solve the 
	problem.</li>
	
	<li>Object-oriented programming was developed to make it possible to abstract details of implementation
	away from the programmer.</li>
	
	<li>Declarative programming is where you write statements describing the problem to be solved.</li>
	
	<li>Functional programming are used as the fundamental building blocks  of a program.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
	<h2>Assembly Language</h2>
	<p>Machine code was the first "language" used to enter programs by early computer programmers. The next
	advance in programming was to use mnemonics instead of binary codes, and this was called assembly code</p>
<hr>
	<h2>Addressing Modes</h2>
	<p>Addressing Modes:
<ul>
	<li>Using immediate addressing, the operand is the actual value to be operated on, say 3</li>
	<li>Using direct addressing, the operand holds the memory address of the value to be operated on, 
	this is used in LMC</li>
	<li>Using indirect addressing, the operand is the location holding the addressof the data we want</li>
	<li>Using indexed addressing, the address of the operand is obtained by adding to the contents of a 
	general register (index register) a constant value.</li>
</ul>
